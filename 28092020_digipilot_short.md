## Aims and focus

### Aims

- Enabling **distant learning** for working-life students
- Providing different types of **pedagogically-informed teaching materials**
- Making the **schedule** more **flexible** for the students
- Providing **immediate feedback** for both students and teachers

### Focus is on 3 master's level courses* (each 5 ECTS)

- **BTK6002**: Introduction to high-throughput data analysis [period **I**]
- **BTK6003**: Biological data analysis [period **II**]
- **BTK6004**: High-throughput sequencing data analysis [periods **III** and **IV**]

\* **Master's** Degree Programme in **Biomedical Technology**

## Materials (5)

### Flipped classroom (1)

- We have used some **elements** of flipped classroom methodology in the **BTK6002** course
- Going to use this in **BTK6003** as well.

### Flipped classroom (2) / Development area &#x1F477;

- Exercise was expected to be viewed and completed before **08.09.2020** - 10 a.m.
  - Only **15 students** have watched the video (data accessed on 23.09.2020-13:00)
  - **All** have viewed the lecture slides.
- According to [Compeau (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006764), the flipped classroom method and its benefits of using it should be discussed with students beforehand for an implementation to be successful.

## Preliminary results / Success &#x1F389;

- &#x1F4C9; **students** are spending less time doing the exercises (compared to last year's implementation)
- &#x1F4C9; Less time spent in grading
- Students are completing more of the assignments
- &#x1F4C8; Some improvements in **students performance** are already visible
- One student attending from abroad without difficulty
