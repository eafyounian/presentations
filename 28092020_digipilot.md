- Supporting and enhancing teachers' work
- Providing immediate feedback for both students and teachers

---

## Focus

### Focus is on 3 master's level courses* (each 5 ECTS)

- **BTK6002**: Introduction to high-throughput data analysis [period **I**]
- **BTK6003**: Biological data analysis [period **II**]
- **BTK6004**: High-throughput sequencing data analysis [periods **III** and **IV**]
<br><br><br>
\* Master's Degree Programme in Biomedical Technology

## Pedagogical considerations (1)

### Constructive alignment

- &#x26A1; **Idea in brief**: To get the most out of the teaching and learning, we have to **align** *intended learning outcomes*, the *teaching activities*, and *the assessment*
- **Constructive** part comes from  *constructivist theories* that argues **the student and her activities** have the **central role** in **creating meaning**
- Quizzes and exercises are designed to
  - be aligned with the **learning outcomes** and **teaching activities** (i.e. lectures and tutorials)
  - increase student's performance in reaching higher levels of complexity (e.g. at least level 3 and 4 in **SOLO taxonomy**)
- **example**: variant calling exercise set (BTK6002, week 4)
  - Prepare data, call variants, annotate, inspect, filter, select, contextualize...
- **Capstone project** is designed to assess students' performance at all 5 levels of the SOLO taxonomy

???

- **constructivism**:
  - learning: knowledge is constructed by the students
  - teaching: guiding to solve problems
- **behaviorism**:
  - learning: expected response. 2x2=4
  - teaching: condition students by repetition
- **cognitivism**:
  - learning: recalling information. Capital of Finland is Hel
  - teaching: help in storing and processing knowledge
- **SOLO**: the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome
  - levels: pre-structural, unistructural, multi-structural, Relational, Extend abstract
  - I: failure and incompetence (no can do!)
  - II: follow simple instructions, identify, name (run bowti2)
  - III: Combine things that are relevant, describe, list (run bowtie2, samtools sort)
  - IV: relation of things together, Analyze, apply, compare, relate (inspect and understand results for above)
  - V: Create, generate, generalize to a new domain (Use all these to analyze new data set, new data type)

## Pedagogical considerations (2)

### **Threshold concepts first** approach vs. maximum coverage

- **Fundamental concepts** of a discipline, learning and understanding of which provides entry to that discipline
  - &#x1F511; &#x1F6AA; to Dante's Paradise &#x1F308;
  - If not learned, students are stuck at a **liminal state** (imagine being stuck at Dante's Purgatory &#x1F311;)
- More troublesome to learn compared to other concepts e.g. *core concepts*
  - Gene expression regulation pathway vs. transcription factor
- Results in changes in perspective and possibly behavior

- less frustration, lower failure rate, better student engagement

## Pedagogical considerations (3)

### Zones of proximal development (ZPD) and scaffolding  

.right-column[

<img src="28092020_digipilot_resources/ZPD.png" style="height: 250px;"/>

]

.leftt-column[

- **ZPD** is the zone in which student can do things **with assistance** &#x1F64B; &#x1F465;
- **Scaffolding** is whatever activities that can provide such assistance
  - Tutorials, animations, exercises, exercise sessions
  - A complex task (e.g. variant calling) is broken down into less complex tasks with step-by-step instructions to advance
  - Each step builds on an earlier step

]

???

- Different zones of student ability
- Same as scaffolds helping a construction worker to reach unreachable floors with his height

## Pedagogical considerations (4)

### Flipped classroom (1)

- An **alternative** to the **traditional lecture**
- **Before the session**, students engage in preliminary learning of a particular topic/concept
  - Watching a short **video** and/or reading parts of a **book**, an **article** or an **encyclopedia entry**
  - **Perform a few tasks/exercises to gauge their understanding**
- **During the session**, the freed time is used to answer/discuss difficulties in understanding encountered by the students before the session
- In essence, it emphasizes a type of **student-centered learning** as opposed by teacher-centered learning
- Additionally, it can be considered as a form of **active learning** as opposed to passive learning 
  - **see**. e.g. [Jensen et al, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1187/cbe.14-08-0129)
- a.k.a. *reverse teaching* (**see** e.g. &#x1F4DA; [The Flipped Classroom](https://isbndb.com/book/9789811034138))

---

## Pedagogical considerations (4)

### Flipped classroom (2)

- We have used some **elements** of flipped classroom methodology in the **BTK6002** course
- Going to use this in **BTK6003** as well.

.center[
<img src="28092020_digipilot_resources/flipped_learning_1.png" style="height: 380px;"/>
]

???

- Students are required to do the task before the session
- For example watch a video on Burrows Wheeler Transform (BWT)

---

## Pedagogical considerations (4)

### Flipped classroom (3)

- Exercise was expected to be viewed and completed before **08.09.2020** - 10 a.m.
  - Only **15 students** have watched the video (data accessed on 23.09.2020-13:00)
  - **All** have viewed the lecture slides.
- According to [Compeau (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006764), the flipped classroom method and its benefits of using it should be discussed with students beforehand for an implementation to be successful.  

.center[
<img src="28092020_digipilot_resources/flipped_learning_2.png" style="height: 250px;"/>
]

???

- Difficult to enforce in the current setup
- We did not push it
- 14th was the deadline for the exercise set
